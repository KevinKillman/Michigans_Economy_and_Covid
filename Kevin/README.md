# Michigan's Economy During the COVID-19 Pandemic

## Overview

This project tasked me with determining a situation in which I could use pandas and the Python programming language to present a real world situation with real world data. I decided to analyze the COVID-19 pandemic and its affect that it has had upon the Michigan Economy. Throughout this project, I used many different sources of information, both through API's and data downloaded to my computer.

## Data
The local data is data downloaded from the Department of Labor and Opportunity Insights Economic Tracker. The Opportunity Insights Economic Tracker data is located at tracktherecovery.org and references paper at this link https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/tracker_paper.pdf.

We are currently using 3 different API's in this project; Bureau of Labor Statistics' Public API, COVID Tracking's API, and Googles Geocoding API.
